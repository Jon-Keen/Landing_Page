# Landing_Page
Greetings!

    This repo consists of my work in relation to the "Landing Page" project from The Odin Project. I'll be adding steps here to help keep myself on track. Also, I will add any references along the way for image ownership.

    1. Build index.html - All sections accounted for? Start at top, main 1, main 2, main3, main 4, and footer.
    2. Add div's, classes, aria, html semantic, mobile compliance?
    3. Build style.css - Complete general framework, add broad items such as background colors, text colors, images.
    4. Style pt.2 - Complete detailed flexbox css styling.
